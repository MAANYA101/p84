Shimla is home to several buildings that are styled in the Tudorbethan and neo-Gothic architectures 
dating from the colonial era, as well as multiple temples and churches. The colonial architecture and 
churches, the temples, and the natural environment of the city attract tourists. Major city centre's 
attractions include the Shri Hanuman Jakhu (Statue), Jakhu Temple, Viceregal Lodge, Christ Church,
 Mall Road, The Ridge and Annadale. The city centre's northernmost point is Jakhoo and the southernmost 
 location is Annadale, the easternmost point is Sanjauli and the western point is Chotta Shimla. 
 The Kalka Shimla Railway line built by the British,[11] a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also a major
  tourist attraction. Owing to its steep terrain, Shimla hosts the mountain biking race MTB Himalaya,
   which started in 2005 and is regarded as the biggest event of its kind in South Asia. Shimla also has 
   the largest natural ice skating rink in South Asia. Apart from being a tourism centre, the city is
    also an educational hub with several colleges and research institutions.
